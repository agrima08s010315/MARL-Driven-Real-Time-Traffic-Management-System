## 🚀 What This Project Does

The project explores whether traffic signals can respond to changing road conditions instead of relying only on fixed timing plans.

Each controlled intersection acts as a traffic agent inside **SUMO**. Python communicates with the simulation through **TraCI**, allowing the controller to observe traffic conditions and adapt signal behaviour during execution.

The system also includes:

- LSTM-based traffic demand forecasting
- emergency vehicle prioritization
- comparison against a rule-based baseline
- TLS 1.3 mutual authentication
- X.509 identities for traffic agents
- RSA-PSS signed messages
- SHA-256 integrity validation
- replay protection using timestamps and nonces
- automated security tests
- executable adversarial scenarios

The traffic-control layer and security layer are intentionally separated so that network messages are validated before they influence a signal decision.

## 📊 Results

The adaptive controller was compared against the project's rule-based traffic-control baseline in SUMO.

| Metric | Rule-Based Baseline | Adaptive System | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Average waiting time | 55 s | 32 s | **41.8% lower** |
| Queue length | 30 vehicles | 15 vehicles | **50% lower** |
| Fuel consumption | 120 L | 90 L | **25% lower** |
| Throughput | 65% | 82% | **17 percentage points higher** |

These results come from the simulation configuration used in this repository. They should not be interpreted as expected performance on a deployed city road network.

## 📜 Patent

### Indian Patent Application No. 202511108091 A

A patent application has been filed for the traffic-management approach developed through this work.

[![View Patent](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20Patent-Google%20Drive-4285F4?style=flat-square&logo=googledrive&logoColor=white)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QSSDN_fmPc41MEugw1atImfDk9ymtrHb/view?usp=sharing)

## 🧩 Why This Project Matters

Fixed-time traffic signals work from predefined schedules.

That becomes inefficient when traffic conditions change significantly across approaches or when emergency vehicles enter the network.

This project focuses on three connected problems:

1. **Adaptive signal control**  
   Traffic signals respond to current traffic conditions.

2. **Traffic demand forecasting**  
   LSTM forecasting is used to model changing vehicle demand.

3. **Secure controller communication**  
   Messages exchanged between traffic agents are authenticated before being trusted.

**SUMO** provides the traffic simulation.

**TraCI** gives the Python controllers access to vehicle states, queues and traffic lights during execution.

## 🧠 Adaptive Traffic Control

Each controlled intersection acts as an independent traffic-signal agent.

### Observed State

The controller can use information such as:

```text
queue length
waiting time
traffic density
emergency vehicle presence
```

### Actions

An agent can modify the active traffic-light phase or associated timing according to the observed state.

### Reward

The implementation penalizes congestion and accumulated waiting time.

```python
reward = -(queue_length + 0.5 * waiting_time)
```

Lower queue length and lower waiting time therefore produce a better reward.

## 📈 LSTM Traffic Forecasting

Traffic demand changes over time, so the project includes an LSTM-based forecasting component.

```text
Historical Traffic
       |
       v
   LSTM Model
       |
       v
Predicted Demand
       |
       v
Vehicle Generation
       |
       v
SUMO Simulation
       |
       v
Adaptive Control
```

The forecasting component allows experiments to use changing demand instead of one static traffic pattern.

## 🚑 Emergency Vehicle Priority

Emergency traffic is treated as a privileged case.

The controller does not trust a message only because it contains:

```json
{
  "emergency": true
}
```

A malicious sender could otherwise request priority without authorization.

Emergency requests therefore pass through the authentication and authorization layer before they influence signal behaviour.

## 🔐 Security Design

The traffic agents form a small distributed system, so the communication path is protected separately from the traffic-control algorithm.

| Threat | Example | Protection |
|---|---|---|
| Agent impersonation | Rogue process claims to be J2 | X.509 identity and certificate trust |
| Message tampering | Signal command is modified | RSA-PSS signature and SHA-256 |
| Replay | Old command is sent again | Nonce and timestamp checks |
| MITM | Traffic is intercepted or redirected | TLS 1.3 mTLS and protected metadata |
| Emergency spoofing | Normal vehicle requests priority | Signed authorization token |
| Untrusted participant | Certificate is from another CA | CA validation |

The project uses multiple layers rather than relying only on TLS.

```text
Application
Emergency Authorization

Message
RSA-PSS
SHA-256
Nonce
Timestamp
Sender / Receiver Binding

Identity
X.509 Certificates
Trusted CA

Transport
TLS 1.3
Mutual TLS
```

For the detailed security design, see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## 🧪 Security Validation

The security layer is tested independently from traffic behaviour.

Current validation includes:

- **17 automated security-focused tests**
- **6 simulated attack classes**
- TLS 1.3 mutual authentication
- X.509 identity validation
- RSA-PSS signatures
- SHA-256 integrity checks
- timestamp freshness
- nonce-based replay protection
- emergency authorization

Run:

```bash
python -m pytest -v tests/test_security.py
```

### Attack Simulation

Run:

```bash
python demo.py
```

The demo covers:

| Scenario | Expected Result |
|---|---|
| Message tampering | Blocked |
| Agent impersonation | Blocked |
| Replay | Blocked |
| MITM redirection | Blocked |
| Emergency spoofing | Blocked |
| Forged authorization token | Blocked |

### TLS Smoke Test

Run:

```bash
python tls_smoke_test.py
```

This validates the mutual TLS path independently from the signed-message tests.

- no production certificate revocation service
- no hardware-backed key storage
- no large-scale DoS mitigation
- no compromised-controller recovery
- no post-quantum cryptography

## 🔭 Possible Next Steps
